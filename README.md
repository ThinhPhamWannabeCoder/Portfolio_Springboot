# Portfolio SpringBoot Backend üçÉ

Welcome to my Portfolio SpringBoot Backend repository! This project serves as the backend component developed for my coursework during my learning journey. It complements my exploration of hard-coded front-end techniques, showcasing my progress in Java and the SpringBoot framework.

## Purpose üéØ 
- **Coursework Backend**: This repository was crafted to support a school coursework project, with a primary focus on backend development using Java and SpringBoot.
- **Learning Journey**: While there's nothing much to see in this repo, but it's my first attempt to write a full-stack website and this repo it's for server side


## Key Features and Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Backend Mastery**: Delve into the intricacies of backend development with Java and SpringBoot.

- **Reflective Archive**: Serving as a personal space, this repository enables me to save my backend progress and periodically revisit the journey.

- **Basic Functionality**: This backend script was used to serve basic CRUD operations for my first website. In other words, it's extremely *essential* for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

**Caution** ‚ùóÔ∏è: While this repository served its purpose during my initial learning phase, it's important to highlight that the code is dated and may not adhere to best practices. **Security Concerns**: Please be aware that the implementation lacks security measures, and it's crucial to avoid deploying this in a production environment.

**Data Safety Warning** ‚ùóÔ∏è: This codebase does not incorporate robust data protection mechanisms. Using it in a real-world scenario could pose significant risks to your data. It's strongly advised not to deploy this script where data safety is a concern, as there are vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity of your information.

**Upgrade and Learn** ‚ùóÔ∏è: As you explore this repository, consider it as a stepping stone in your learning journey. I recommend upgrading to more secure and modern practices when implementing backend solutions. Feel free to use this repository as a benchmark to observe your progress and learning curve.


## Insights üë®‚Äçüíª
At the time of writing this repository, I was not familiar with environment setup or testing methodologies. Despite its simplicity and potential shortcomings, it primarily focuses on *CRUD operations*. While it might not meet industry standards, it stands as a testament to my learning journey, and I find satisfaction in the progress made.

I acknowledge that there is room for improvement, and I am committed to continuing my learning journey to enhance my skills. The lessons learned from this project will guide me in creating more robust and refined solutions in future projects. Your insights and feedback are always appreciated as I strive to evolve and refine my skills! üöÄ
